# Clock Project

This is a simple clock project that takes user input for a time duration in minutes and starts two timers simultaneously: a countdown timer and a count-up timer. Both timers start at the same time, with the countdown timer counting down from the input time to zero, and the count-up timer counting up from zero to the input time.

## Features

- User can input a time in minutes.
- Countdown timer counts down from the input time to zero.
- Count-up timer counts up from zero to the input time.
- Both timers run simultaneously and stop when the countdown timer reaches zero.
